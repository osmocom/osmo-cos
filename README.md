osmo-cos - early code about a Card OS on CC32RS512
==================================================

This repository contains some very early experimentation code about a
Card Operating system (COS) for ChipCity CC32RS512 based smart cards.

The project is abandoned by now, due to lack of time (and lack of
availability of more cards from Chipcity).

The project is part of the [Osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) Open Source
Mobile Communications projects.
